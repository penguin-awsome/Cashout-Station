# Cashout-Station

Hello everybody, this is my latest project: The Cashout Station!

This project is inspired from my favorite video game,'The Finals', a team based FPS shooter, as well as one of my friends projects: https://github.com/jamdotjar/ULTRATERM which is another terminal inspired from a video game. In the game, the cashout is the objective point, where you insert the 'Cashbox' to begin an objective point. In my version, you insert the cahbox to launch the game and play some of the game music.

It uses a NFC Detector to detect when the cashbox has been inserted via an NFC tag, and uses a servo motor to pull the box in and close the opening for th ebox as well. It is powered by a 9v battery being stepped down to 5v to run a Xiao ESP32-C6 which is the brains of the operation. It also includes some LEDs for flair and a speaker and mini amp for the sound. It also has two buttons, one for opening up the insertion slot and one for ejecting it.

Here are some photos of the finished design:

It's been really fun, albeit exausing working on this project due to a time crunch for submission time, but I'm so exited to actually build and use this thing! If you want to see the finished project, I'll be adding some photos and maybe a quick video here when completed hopefully before august 7th (The deadline)
