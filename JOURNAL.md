Created a sketch of my design:

Did some research today and started my schematic. Had trouble choosing a NFC reader but I think I found a good one. I did have to create a custom footprint though for the connection to the PCB. I think its going well but a long way to go

I have relatively busy around this time, but I know if I want to get this project done soon I have to kinda lock in. I've spent my free time researching mainly, figuring out how to wire everthing up, and thinking about final assemblemy.

This included choosing a motor type, battery voltage step-down, and speaker amp. I also have chosen a good few of my parts and finished my schematic!

I apologize for the multi-day entry but I haven't really been getting enough done on each day to justify a full entry. Overall things are going well and I just have to:
- Check Schematic
- Assign Footprints
- Create PCB
- 3D Design
- Software
- Get Approved
- Order Parts
- Build!

It's going to be tight but I think I can do it.
